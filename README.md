# Uncommon HTML Bug: Accidental DOM Element Removal

This repository demonstrates a subtle yet impactful error in HTML and JavaScript. The bug involves inadvertently removing a DOM element instead of merely hiding it, making it impossible to re-display the element without reloading the page.

## Bug Description
The `myFunction()` JavaScript function, when called, removes the div element with the ID 'myDiv' using `remove()`.  The intended behavior is likely to hide the div using `style.display = 'none'`. Removing the element permanently deletes it from the DOM, causing unexpected behavior for applications that depend on its existence.

## Solution
The solution modifies the `myFunction()` to correctly hide the element using `style.display = 'none';`. This prevents accidental permanent removal.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `bug.html` file in your browser.
3. Click the button. You'll notice the div disappears completely.
4. Open `solution.html` to see the corrected code that hides the div instead.
